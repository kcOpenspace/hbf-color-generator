# QUICK README

# Booting up the app
Quick npm install packages and np run dev to start the app.

# Thoughts on project
Initially attempted to bootstrap the project wiht Preact/Typescript but soon ran into hurdles with getting it configured to start. Nothing that can't be fixed but required time to configure working properly.
Possibly a bit overkill for this demo.
So Pivoted to React.

Used Copilot to initialise the color logic in the generateColor function.
Due to time constraints.
Needs refinement and re purposing as it does not seem to do the job as invisioned.

## Options
To include an image download button.

## WANTED TO
Wanted to spend more time in styling the site with basic header and footer components and add more aesthetics.
